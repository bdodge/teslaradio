compatible: "level,adc-ratio"

properties:
  enable-rail:
    type: phandle
    required: false
    description: |
      Power rail needed to support reading, activated by adc driver

  active-when-gpio:
    type: phandle
    required: false
    description: |
      Reading is only valid if this gpio is activated by some other means (not adc driver)

    required: true
    description: |
      ADC channel index

  full-ohms:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Resistance of the full path through the voltage divider (top + bottom resistor).

  output-ohms:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Resistance of the lower leg of the voltage divider (bottom resistor)

  sample-period-ms:

  label:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: Human readable string describing the device (used by Zephyr for API name)

  status:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: indicates the operational status of a device
    enum:
      - "ok"
